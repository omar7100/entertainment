                    The series is set in the 1870s in Deadwood, South Dakota, before and after the area's annexation by the Dakota Territory, and charts Deadwood's growth from camp to town.

                  Steve is an American syndicated talk show that was hosted by comedian and television personality Steve Harvey. 
                    It premiered on September 5, 2017, as a successor to Harvey's Chicago-based Steve Harvey talk show produced by Endemol. 
                    The series was produced from Universal Studios in California in partnership with IMG,
                     and was described as having a larger focus on celebrity guests and Harvey's comedy 
                     (as opposed to the previous series, which focused more on human interest topics).
